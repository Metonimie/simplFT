# simplFT
This project was made for the purpose of me to learn and understand Go better and also for the Computer Networking class
that I took in Fall 2017 at UPT.

The scope of this project is to implement a simple server that handles multiple clients and allows the clients to
execute commands on it.

The client is soon to come.
